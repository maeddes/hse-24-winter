## **2024 / 09 / 23 - Introduction to distributed systems - Overview Cloud Computing**  

### **Content Overview**
1. **The NIST Cloud Definition (2011)**
   - Breakdown of the NISTâ€™s five essential cloud characteristics, deployment models, and service models.
  
2. **Overview of Major Cloud Providers**
   - Key players in the cloud space (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).
   - Comparing evolution.

3. **Cloud Service/Abstraction Models**
   - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS revisited, with modern examples.
   - The evolution of abstraction models, including FaaS and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS).

4. **Introduction to CNCF**
   - Role of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the cloud ecosystem.
   - CNCF Landscape: technologies, tools, and projects.

5. **Popular Technologies**
   - **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration in cloud-native environments.
   - **eBPF**: Extending kernel capabilities for monitoring and security.
   - **OpenTelemetry**: Observability standards and practices in modern cloud systems.

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Describe the NIST cloud definition and its significance in the modern cloud landscape.
- Identify the major cloud providers and tell about their evolution.
- Differentiate between cloud service models and discuss their evolution, including modern abstraction models like CaaS.
- Explain the role of CNCF and analyze the CNCF landscape to identify key technologies and trends.
- Provide an overview of Kubernetes, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry, explaining their impact on cloud-native development.

### **Student/Review Questions**
#### For now:
1. What are the five essential characteristics of cloud computing according to NIST, and how do they apply to modern cloud services?
2. Identify 3 main cloud providers.
3. What are the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS? Give examples of each in today's cloud ecosystem.
4. What is the CNCF, and why is it important in the context of cloud-native technologies?
#### For later:
5. How does Kubernetes help in managing containerized applications in cloud-native environments?
6. What is eBPF, and what advantages does it provide in terms of system monitoring and security?
7. Explain the role of OpenTelemetry in modern cloud systems. How does it contribute to observability?

### Homework

- Get a GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket account

## **2024 / 09 / 30 - Overview of distributed systems implementation options - Frameworks, Kubernetes, Service Meshes (sidecar-based and eBPF-based)**

## **2024 / 09 / 30 - Cloud-based IDEs**

## **2024 / 10 / 7 - Containers**
### Content Overview

1. Development in distributed teams withouth containers and the potential problems:
   - Polyglot application landscapes are challenging as all work environments need to match all runtime requirements for all languages
   - Transporting application from environment A to environment B introduces challenges and problems with mismatching runtimes

2. **Containers**
   - Isolate Applications from each other
   - Package Applications along with all Runtime requirements for easy execution and transportation between working environments
   - Simplify configuration of working environments -> only container engine needed
   - handling of all application containers through same mechanisms: docker build, docker run

3. **Docker**
   - Docker ecosystem consists of the Docker Daemon, Docker CLI and Docker Hub+
   - Creation of Dockerfiles
   - Building Images
   - Running Containers

4. **Exercises**
   - Exercises can be found at: https://lecture.new.trainings.nvtc.io/basics/container/

### **Student/Review Questions**
1. What is Docker, and how does it differ from traditional virtual machines?
2. Explain the concept of a Docker image and a Docker container. How are they related?
3. What are the main components of a Dockerfile? Describe the purpose of each component.
4. How does Docker ensure isolation and security between containers?
5. What is a container registry, and how do you use Docker Hub to share or deploy images?
6. Describe the process of building and running a containerized application using Docker, including common commands.

### Homework
- Get a Dockerhub account
- Work through the exercises
