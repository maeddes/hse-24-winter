## **2024 / 10 / 7 - Containers**
### Content Overview

1. Development in distributed teams withouth containers and the potential problems:
   - Polyglot application landscapes are challenging as all work environments need to match all runtime requirements for all languages
   - Transporting application from environment A to environment B introduces challenges and problems with mismatching runtimes

2. **Containers**
   - Isolate Applications from each other
   - Package Applications along with all Runtime requirements for easy execution and transportation between working environments
   - Simplify configuration of working environments -> only container engine needed
   - handling of all application containers through same mechanisms: docker build, docker run
