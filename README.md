   - **Idempotency**: Ensuring repeatable requests yield the same results to prevent unintended side effects.
   - **Richardson's Maturity Model**: Levels of RESTful maturity, from Level 0 (HTTP as a tunnel) to Level 3 (HATEOAS), to understand API design progression.

---

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Describe the CAP Theorem, its components, and how it affects design choices in distributed systems.
- Explain Conwayâ€™s Law and its influence on software architecture, especially in the context of microservices.
- List and apply the 12 factors for building scalable, portable, and maintainable applications.
- Define and differentiate microservices architecture from other architectural styles.
- Understand and apply REST principles, including HTTP methods, status codes, and idempotency, to design effective APIs.
- Recognize different levels of RESTful API maturity and their implications for API design.

### **ABOVE ALL**

Be able to relate the concepts of CAP theorem and the 12-factor apps to the technologies we are covering in the lecture,
e.g. how do technologies like Spring Boot (or other frameworks/languages), Docker, Kubernetes incorporate or implement those aspects

---

### **Student/Review Questions**
1. What are the components of the CAP Theorem, and why canâ€™t a distributed system fully achieve all three?
2. How does Conwayâ€™s Law impact the structure of a distributed system, especially when adopting a microservices architecture?
3. What are the key factors of a 12-factor app, and how do they contribute to application scalability and resilience?
4. Describe microservices concepts and some of its advantages over a monolithic architecture.
5. What are the basic components of HTTP and their role in RESTful APIs?
6. Who is Roy Fielding, and what are the core principles of REST as outlined in his dissertation?
7. In RESTful API design, why is it essential to distinguish between nouns and verbs? Provide an example of an appropriate noun-verb pairing in a REST API.
8. List at least three common HTTP status codes and explain their meanings.
9. What is idempotency, and why is it important in the context of REST APIs? Provide an example of an idempotent HTTP method.
10. Describe the levels of Richardsonâ€™s Maturity Model. Why is each level a step toward a more RESTful API?

X. Describe the factor of configuration, why is it important in distributed systems (theory) and how is it being implemented in
Spring Boot, Docker and Kubernetes. Provide examples.

Spring Boot: app.props (e.g. DB config, ports(!)), ..., ...

XI. Which effects does it have, if you store the port configuration in the source code? -> It can never be changed without a rebuilt. You externalize the part of the configuration you want to be able to change

XII. Why is this factor more important on a distributed system than a "monolithic one"? ... configuration ... in a distributed environment ... will change, it needs to be dynamically changeable (without rebuilt!)

XIII. Why is the dockerfile not the part for external configuration? How would you apply external configuration in a docker environment? docker-compose(environment), docker run (-e, -p)
