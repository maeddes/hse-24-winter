     - **Spring Boot**: Managing settings such as database connections and ports using `application.properties` or `application.yml` files to keep them outside the core application logic.
     - **Docker**: Externalizing configuration with `docker-compose` files, `docker run` commands (e.g., `-e` for environment variables and `-p` for port mapping), and avoiding hardcoding in Dockerfiles to support flexibility.
     - **Kubernetes**: Using ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage application settings, making it easy to adjust configurations dynamically without rebuilding containers.

2. **Lookout on lab**

---

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of separating configuration from code, specifically in the context of distributed systems.
- Relate the configuration principle of the 12-factor methodology to technologies such as Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- Describe how these technologies implement configuration externalization to support flexibility, scalability, and best practices in distributed systems.
- Discuss the impact of improper configuration management in distributed systems and the challenges of maintaining dynamic configuration across different environments.

---

### **Student/Review Questions**

1. Describe the configuration factor in the 12-factor methodology. Why is it essential for distributed systems, and how is it implemented in Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes?  
   *Example Answer: In distributed systems, configuration often varies between environments. Spring Boot uses `application.properties` files for settings like database connections and ports, Docker supports configuration via `docker-compose` and `docker run` options, and Kubernetes uses ConfigMaps and Secrets.*

2. What happens if you store port configuration directly in your source code?  
   *Answer: The port configuration becomes fixed, requiring a rebuild of the application if changes are needed. Externalizing this allows easy updates without code changes.*

3. Why is external configuration more crucial for a distributed system than a monolithic application?  
   *Answer: Distributed systems often require dynamic configuration changes across multiple services or containers, whereas monolithic applications generally have fewer, more static configuration needs.*

4. Why isnâ€™t the Dockerfile suited for storing external configurations? How can you apply configurations in a Docker environment?  
   *Answer: Dockerfiles are designed for building images, not for external settings that may change. Configuration should be applied at runtime using `docker-compose` or the `docker run` command with `-e` for environment variables and `-p` for port mapping.*

   - **Spring Data**: Provided an overview of Spring Data, a Spring module that simplifies data access by reducing repetitive code and offering a consistent programming model across data storage types.
   - **Spring Data JPA**: Discussed Spring Data JPA as a specialized implementation of Spring Data tailored to Java Persistence API (JPA) usage, allowing us to interact with relational databases using repository interfaces. Explained the benefits of JPA repositories, including CRUD operations and query generation.

2. **Spring Boot Application Enhancements**  
   - Transitioned the shopping list app from using an `ArrayList` for storage to a relational database with **Spring Data JPA** and **PostgreSQL** integration.
   - Created endpoints for CRUD operations, implemented a repository interface to manage shopping list items, and added a custom `getItemByName` method.
   - Added logic to handle duplicate item names by increasing their amount instead of creating new entries, leveraging Spring Data JPAâ€™s powerful querying capabilities.

3. **Flask Frontend Setup**  
   - Developed a **Flask frontend** to interact with the Spring Boot API, allowing students to create a basic user interface for interacting with the shopping list.
   - Configured the Flask app to read the **API URL** from an environment variable, supporting flexible connections to the backend environment.
   - Verified that the Flask interface could successfully perform actions such as adding, updating, and deleting items on the shopping list by interacting with the REST API endpoints.

4. **Dockerizing the Spring Boot and Flask Applications**  
   - Guided students through creating a Docker image for the Spring Boot app and the Flask frontend, along with configuration of a **Docker Compose** file to orchestrate both services along with PostgreSQL.
   - Demonstrated how **Docker Compose** enables easy deployment and configuration of multi-container applications by defining all components in a single, reusable setup file.
   - Discussed best practices for containerizing the Spring Boot app with PostgreSQL for persistence and the Flask app for frontend interactions, ensuring portability and streamlined setup for the full application stack.
