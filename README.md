     - **Kubernetes**: Using ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage application settings, making it easy to adjust configurations dynamically without rebuilding containers.

2. **Lookout on lab**

---

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Explain the importance of separating configuration from code, specifically in the context of distributed systems.
- Relate the configuration principle of the 12-factor methodology to technologies such as Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- Describe how these technologies implement configuration externalization to support flexibility, scalability, and best practices in distributed systems.
- Discuss the impact of improper configuration management in distributed systems and the challenges of maintaining dynamic configuration across different environments.

---

### **Student/Review Questions**

1. Describe the configuration factor in the 12-factor methodology. Why is it essential for distributed systems, and how is it implemented in Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes?  
   *Example Answer: In distributed systems, configuration often varies between environments. Spring Boot uses `application.properties` files for settings like database connections and ports, Docker supports configuration via `docker-compose` and `docker run` options, and Kubernetes uses ConfigMaps and Secrets.*

2. What happens if you store port configuration directly in your source code?  
   *Answer: The port configuration becomes fixed, requiring a rebuild of the application if changes are needed. Externalizing this allows easy updates without code changes.*

3. Why is external configuration more crucial for a distributed system than a monolithic application?  
   *Answer: Distributed systems often require dynamic configuration changes across multiple services or containers, whereas monolithic applications generally have fewer, more static configuration needs.*

4. Why isnâ€™t the Dockerfile suited for storing external configurations? How can you apply configurations in a Docker environment?  
   *Answer: Dockerfiles are designed for building images, not for external settings that may change. Configuration should be applied at runtime using `docker-compose` or the `docker run` command with `-e` for environment variables and `-p` for port mapping.*
