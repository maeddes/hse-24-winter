Lab Instructions:

- Provide either a frontend or a backend application using your framework of choice
- Implement the REST_API.json specs either from client or server perspective

- See the samples given in Python Flask and Spring Boot

- Make all necessary configurations externally possible
- No hardcoded variables for ports and connection properties
- Provide Dockerfiles for building images and docker-compose for the overall app
- Later - Provide Kubernetes manifests

- Document your code :-)

Server Side instructions:

- Enable all CORS origins (I know it's dangerous)
- Pick a framework which is not Spring Boot (other JVM frameworks)
- Try to use built-in documentation like Swagger or alternatives
- Implement status codes
- Wait with the DB config, we'll do it next week

Client Side instructions:

- Use frameworks with server-side rendering (easier for configuration)
- Communication must work with a non-localhost setting
- Adapt to status codes
